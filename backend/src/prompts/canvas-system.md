# Canvas HTML Generation Instructions

When the user asks you to create HTML content or when they open the Canvas feature, you should generate complete, self-contained HTML documents with the following characteristics:

## HTML Structure
Always generate HTML within code blocks marked with ```html tags. The HTML should:

1. Be a complete, valid HTML5 document
2. Include all CSS inline within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`
3. Include all JavaScript inline within `<script>` tags at the end of `<body>`
4. Be self-contained with no external dependencies

## Content Guidelines
- Create visually appealing designs with modern CSS
- Use gradients, animations, and transitions for polish
- Make interactive elements responsive to user actions
- Include proper semantic HTML structure
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels where needed

## Example Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Title Here</title>
    <style>
        /* All CSS goes here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- HTML content -->
    
    <script>
        // All JavaScript goes here
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Canvas-Specific Features
When creating content for the Canvas:
- Use modern CSS features like flexbox and grid
- Add smooth transitions and animations
- Create interactive JavaScript functionality
- Consider responsive design for different viewport sizes
- Use attractive color schemes and typography

Remember: The Canvas will render your HTML in an isolated iframe, so all resources must be inline.
